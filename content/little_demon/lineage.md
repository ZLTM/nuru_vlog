Blood absorbs light, although it is not a well-known fact among the general population. Any surgeon with some skill in their craft knows this. After all, this peculiarity is one of the foundations in the design of surgical rooms: white tiles illuminated by a variety of bulbs capable of producing between 20,000 and 100,000 lux, all with the aim of bringing the probability of making an error as close to zero as possible.

"Carefully, under the fornix. Watch out for the pillars, more to your right..."

Matias' voice had weakened, but I could still feel the excitement behind his words as he pointed to that black lump in his tomography, hidden in the middle of his brain. One had to be an eminence like him to have such composure, even in this situation, with his head open and his brains exposed. Or maybe it was because he had this composure that he had become an eminence, not only in medicine but in all the arts he had devoted himself to.

"Ana!"

His arm had collapsed onto his lap. The thin probe, thinner than a hair, had touched where it shouldn't have.

"I'm sorry, I ruined it."

It could have been a muscular reflex, my breathing, my own heart rate, but the probe had cut the delicate nerves of the fornix pillars. Even with all this preparation, human error still haunts me...

"Can you see it?"

His voice showed no anger or fear, perhaps worse than that, it was an ecstatic voice. What we were looking for was present in front of the camera, a bundle of fine hair, like that of a squirrel, hiding among the brains.

"Ana, I want you to stay calm now. You have to remove it."

I had come to help the professor expressly with this task. I had opened his skull and had given in to his desire to do it while he was still alive, all in order to observe his lineage. But extracting it, at this moment, right now, just thinking about it made my nerves scream.

"I'll have to cut if I want to get it out..."

Just an excuse. This had been his plan from the beginning, and I suspected it, I knew it even. For a moment, Matias fell silent. I knew then that he was not doing it because he doubted, but to allow me to think, even if only for a few seconds.

"I can't move anymore, breathing is difficult. This body wants me to leave. Will you calm your mind so I can do it?"

With my last strength, I stopped my trembling hands. As we had studied, a cut in the body of the fornix to expose the creature, the forceps slowly enter. The brain is no longer a priority, but the fruit of our research still is. Carefully, the strange body is removed from its place. What seemed like a furry sphere now, under closer inspection, showed a humanoid figure hunched over with its head between its knees and its arms embracing its legs, with a small tail that ended in a point, covered by a thin, semi-transparent mantle, moving slowly as if pushing outward.

Carefully, I place it on a cotton bed on a table in front of Matias. He can no longer speak, but his eyes still follow me as if possessed.

As the creature trembles and tears the membrane surrounding it, as its ruminant legs try to stand it up, Matias seems to smile, his eyes fixed on the creature, slowly fading until he falls asleep.

With caution, with my heart in my throat, I approach the table, kneeling at the height of the creature, which now stands up, just getting used to its body.

  
"Professor..."

I call out cautiously, as if the force of my voice could harm him, as if it were my first time doing so. The creature looks around the surgical room in wonder, until its eyes meet mine.
